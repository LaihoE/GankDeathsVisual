# Tool for checking out how warding affects your deaths

![alt text](https://github.com/LaihoE/GankDeathsVisual/blob/master/wardgraph.png?raw=true)

**Setting up**

To use the tool you need to get a free API-key from Riot: https://developer.riotgames.com/

You also need to download chromedriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

**How it works**

The tool is far from perfect, but it checks for when you died and how many assists the kill had. 

For sololaners: Death with 1 assist = death by gank. 

For duolaners: Death with 2 assists = death by gank.
